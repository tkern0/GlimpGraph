# GlimpGraph
A PC interpreter of BGLs from the app Glimp.

## Setup
This assumes you already have Glimp setup to read from your sensor.

#### Method A
1. Connect your phone to your PC as a media device  

2. Browse to the phone, and from the base directory copy the file 'GlicemiaMisurazioni.csv' elsewhere on your PC
   Make sure not to use the same file, the program makes it unreadable by Glimp

3. Download the latest release of this program from [here](https://github.com/tkern0/GlimpGraph/releases).  
   This is a single .exe which you can store anywhere.

4. Drag and drop 'GlicemiaMisurazioni.csv' onto this exe.

   Tap the drop down menu and go to 'Options' then 'Remote glucose monitoring'.
